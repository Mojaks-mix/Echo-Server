# IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
*Introduction to Intrusion Detection System:
  An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a critical component of a security infrastructure that helps detect and respond to potential security threats. The provided Java code represents an IDS implementation.

*Key Components and Functionality:
  -The IDS runs as a server listening for incoming connections on a specified port.
  -It establishes connections with the Application Server and the Intrusion Prevention Server.
  -Incoming client requests are processed in a separate thread to handle multiple connections simultaneously.
  -The IDS checks the client payload for potential attacks by comparing it against predefined attack patterns.
  -If an attack is detected, an alert is sent to the Intrusion Prevention Server for further handling.
